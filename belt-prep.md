  - do not dm us, do not use "ask host for help" in zoom, do not come find us in a different breakout room
  - tag each of us in the message and put your breakout room number
    - ```@dojo_Shawn_Converse @dojo_Winter_Perrone @dojo_Kaija_Pendergast @dojo_David_Moore I need help/grading in room XX```
- ASK YOUR QUESTION
  - do not worry if we can answer or not. let us decide
- 20 minute rule

## Plagiarism

### What is it?

- Taking someone else's work and submitting as your own
- Talk with your cohort mates
  - this is a solo exam

### What isn't it?
- Code Snippets
  - portions of code

### What can you use?
- google, w3schools, stack overflow
- Learn Platform
- your own notes/assignments
- My lecture code
- ASKING FOR HELP

### Why Shouldn't you plagiarism?
- Coding Dojo
  - you will be expelled for exams
  - for assignments you get an AP
- In the Industry
  - Lawsuits
- Lets say you go through the entire program cheating and you were not caught
  - When a prespective employer asks what you've learned/done, your resopnse will be "nothing, i cheated"
