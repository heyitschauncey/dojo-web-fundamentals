## Plagirism

### What is it?

- Searching up on google/github "Coding Dojo Web Fund Exam" and copying and submitting their code as your own
- Talking to your cohort mates
  - this is a test of your ability

### What isn't it?

- Code snippets

### What can you use?

- Your notes/assignments
- The learn platform
- My lectures and lecture code
- Google/w3schools/stack overflow/etc
- ASKING FOR HELP

### What can't you use?

- other peoples exams

### Why Shouldn't you plagiarize?

- Coding Dojo
  - On exams, immediately expelled
  - On assignments, its an AP
- Industry
  - Lawsuits
  - Blacklisting
- Lets say you go through the whole program cheating and don't get caught
  - When asked by an prospective what you've done/learned, you'll respond with a hearty "NOTHING"

## Tips and Tricks

- what to prioritize:
  - Cannot pass without at least 1 JS feature (try for 2)
  - Get all HTML content and validate
- Get Sleep
- Take small breaks away from your computer
- Have your project folder ready before you start
- Don't watch the clock
  - instead, set alarms (e.g. halfway mark, 1 hour left mark, 10 min mark)
- DON'T PANIC
  - the exam is just an assignment with a time limit
  - nothing new on this exam, everything is from the core assignments and learn platform
- Ask for Help
- Dojo weather or redoing core assignments
- To review, actually dont just read/watch
